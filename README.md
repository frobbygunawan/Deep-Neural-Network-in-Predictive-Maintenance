# Deep-Neural-Network-in-Predictive-Maintenance

## Project Overview
This project attempts to apply deep neural network to machine failure prediction, which might be useful in industry to reduce downtime and product qualities. 
The particular dataset from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/AI4I+2020+Predictive+Maintenance+Dataset) was donated by the author Stephan Matzka, 'Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Predictive Maintenance Applications', Third International Conference on Artificial Intelligence for Industries (AI4I 2020), 2020. 
While it is understandable that explainable algorithm was employed (to find causation based on theoretical knowledge), the "black-box" model such as neural network could be utilized for potentially faster deployment and higher predictive power, although recent advances in explainable ML algorithm could supersede this paradigm.
